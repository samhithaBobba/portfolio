      <h2>ðŸŽ¨ About Me</h2>
      <p>Iâ€™ve loved technology ever since I was a kid making pivot stick figure animations. That early curiosity inspired me to dive deeper into tech, and during my internship at Wipro, I built a web-based pizza-ordering app. My dedication paid off when I was promoted to a full-time Software Engineer role, where I led impactful projects like optimizing deployments for Ericssonâ€™s Network Management system. I used tools like Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Python to save countless hours by automating processes and improving system performance.</p>
      <p>ðŸ“š To further grow my skills and knowledge, Iâ€™m now pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Iâ€™ve tackled exciting academic projects, like a Credit Card Fraud Detection system, which achieved over 97% precision, and an Emotion-Based Movie Recommendation system that boosted user engagement by 30%.</p>
      <p>ðŸŒŸ Along the way, Iâ€™ve earned certifications in RPA Development, Python, and Analytics, and have developed a strong foundation in programming, cloud platforms, and DevOps tools. Iâ€™m passionate about blending creativity with technology to solve real-world challenges and make life smarter, faster, and more efficient.</p>
      <p>ðŸ“© <strong>Letâ€™s Connect:</strong> Iâ€™m just a message awayâ€”letâ€™s connect and rock with technology!</p>
